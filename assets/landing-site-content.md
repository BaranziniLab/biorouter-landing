### Summary (from presentation)
**Core message:** BioRouter is an Agentic-AI-powered Integrated Biomedical Research Environment.

**Problem statement:**
- Biomedical researchers face: heavy local compute needs, unique local setups, proprietary codebases, on-prem datasets, sensitive patient/research data
- Commercial AI services are limited due to privacy/security
- UCSF enterprise AI lacks agentic support

**Solution — BioRouter is an all-in-one tool with:**
- Security offered by enterprise AI models
- Ability to orchestrate diverse workflows with AI agents
- Share workflows without sharing data across collaborations

**One platform that unifies:**
- Commercial, institution-hosted, and local LLMs
- AI agents
- Information Commons databases

**Supports:**
- Customizable workflows for exploratory analysis, prototyping, automation
- Federated cross-institution collaboration

**Key capability — Share Workflow and Skills:**
- Can be shared across institutions
- Standardized analysis pipelines with AI-driven adaptation

**Key capability — Diverse Research Database Connections:**
- Structured and unstructured electronic health records
- Biological knowledge graph (SPOKE)

**Conclusion — BioRouter:**
- Unifies the full research stack (commercial + institution-hosted + local AI models)
- Is secure by design: enterprise-grade AI security
- Enables agentic orchestration and automation
- Is federated-collaboration-ready
- Offers growing ecosystem (skills, agents, databases, etc.)
- Ongoing: UCSF Institution-managed AI Agent Marketplace (quality-controlled, community-driven)

### Feature Cards (6)

## Tab 2 — Download (`download.html`)

### Hero
- Version badge: "v1.20.0 — February 2026"
- Title: "Download BioRouter"
- Subtitle: "Native installers for every major platform. Open source and free."

### Smart OS Detection
JavaScript detects the visitor's OS and shows the recommended download button prominently.

**Detection logic:**
- macOS Apple Silicon (arm) → arm64.dmg
- macOS Intel → x64.dmg
- Windows → win32-x64.zip
- Linux → amd64.deb (default for Linux)
- Unknown/iOS/Android → show all options without a primary
